## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Just a basic static site.

## Optimizations/Issues

- Our white Island logo with <> is not actually a logo. It is a picture of the Island with carrots around it.
- 'Team' section needs to be finished (bio/picture etc).
- V2 of the website could be a Jekyll or Wordpress site.
